here is some feedback/suggestions for you about my experience with SparxItSolutions.

Firstly, I'd like to say that working with Logan is a pleasure. He is very skilled at what he does and finds ways to achieve the outcomes I am seeking even when I am not 100% sure what the outcome should look like or be.

This has been a work in progress on both sides. We have learned to work together with each other and identify where we both need to be more clear or provide more explanation to each other.  

I think this is a big one – explaining things. There is an assumption on both sides that about understanding. Sometimes I have assumed that Logan and the team understand what I want and they don’t exactly understand the way I need them too and  I think at times they think I understand their explanations or what they are doing when sometimes I don’t. 

The biggest suggestion I could give would be that more questions should be asked. Any time an assumption has been made (on both sides) it has led to problems. The team should not be afraid to ask the client many times about something if they feel understanding is not met. That could be that they think the client has not understood them, or if they are assuming that the client means something that they have not directly said.

I have worked through issues like this with the team over all the works we have completed together  and I think we have come to a good place with this , and are now working together very well but as with all things, there is always room for things to be more improved. :)

All in all, I have been very happy with the work Logan & the team does and look forward to continued work with them.
A little more than a few words :)
